MicroStrategyIServerScripts
====================================

MicroStrategyIServerScripts provide different scripts for the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server:
<ul>
<li>isstate.py:	Script to show the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server's status</li>
<li>isversion.py: Script to show the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server's version</li>
<li>isstart.py:	Script to start the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server and check the state afterwards</li>
<li>isstop.py: Script to stop the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server and check the state afterwards</li>
<li>isterminate.py: Script to terminate the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server (Hardcore-stopping the Intelligence Server)</li>
</ul>

The script was written and tested in Python 2.6.8 but runs as well in Python 2.7.9.

## Basic usage:
To add those scripts, copy the py-Files to your server under the /root-Folder and change the mode
to be executable via:
```bash
chmod 755 isstate.py
chmod 755 isstart.py
chmod 755 isstop.py
chmod 755 isversion.py
chmod 755 isterminate.py
```

## To execute the scripts:
```python
python isstate.py
python isstart.py
python isstop.py
python isversion.py
python isterminate.py
```

## To define the aliases for the current user:
Create a new file (if it doesnâ€™t already exist) in the /<username> folder (e.g. /root) called .bashrc and add the aliases from [Bash.basrc](https://github.com/SeppPenner/MicroStrategyIServerScripts/blob/master/Bash.bashrc).
Or copy the file [Bash.basrc](https://github.com/SeppPenner/MicroStrategyIServerScripts/blob/master/Bash.bashrc) to the server and rename it to .bashrc.

## Change the paths in the scripts:
You will need to change the paths in the scripts to your MicroStrategy Intelligence Server's installation file.
